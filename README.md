# Work Day Scheduler

---

## Description
This application was created in order to keep a schedule of your 9-5 job. 

During the hour the box attached to that hour will turn red, boxes in the future are green, and the past times are grey. 

You may type in the boxes and if you save your text with the blue save button on the right then it will save to local storage and persist when the page is refreshed.

Moment.js and JQuery were used to create this application.
